# Feature Engineering Class

This repository contains a Python class, `FeatureEngineering`, designed to streamline the feature engineering process for a given pandas DataFrame. It includes methods for handling missing values, creating aggregate features, extracting temporal features, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. This implementation is part of a specific branch for a feature engineering task.

## Branch Information

- **Branch Name**: `Task-3`
- **Notebook Folder**: `notebooks/feature_engineering.ipynb`

## Features

- Remove columns with high percentages of missing values.
- Create aggregate features based on transaction data.
- Extract temporal features from timestamp data.
- Handle missing values using various strategies (imputation or removal).
- Encode categorical variables using one-hot or label encoding.
- Normalize or standardize numerical features.

## Installation

To use the `FeatureEngineering` class, ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
